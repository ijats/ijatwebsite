# Editorial Policies

At the **International Journal of Applied Technology Solutions (IJATS)**, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of ethical publishing, rigorous peer review, and editorial integrity.

---

## Peer Review Process

IJATS employs a **double-blind peer review** model where both the reviewers and authors remain anonymous.  
Each manuscript is evaluated by at least two independent experts based on originality, methodology, significance, clarity, and relevance to the journal's aims and scope.

Reviewers are selected based on their expertise and impartiality, and review outcomes are communicated promptly to the authors.

## Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement

IJATS follows the **Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE)** guidelines to uphold integrity in publishing.  
We expect authors, reviewers, and editors to adhere to ethical practices, including but not limited to:

<div style="padding-left: 20px;">
<ul>
  <li>Proper citation of sources</li>
  <li>Avoidance of plagiarism</li>
  <li>Honest data reporting</li>
  <li>Transparency in conflict of interest disclosures</li>
  <li>Respect for confidentiality during the review process</li> 
</ul>
</div>

Cases of research misconduct are handled with zero tolerance.

## Authorship and Contributions

Authorship credit should be based on substantial contributions to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the research.  
All listed authors should have approved the final version of the manuscript and agreed to its submission.

---

## Conflict of Interest

Authors, reviewers, and editors must disclose any financial or non-financial conflicts of interest that could influence the research or review process.

---

## Corrections, Retractions, and Expressions of Concern

IJATS is committed to promptly addressing errors, concerns, or ethical issues after publication.  
We follow COPE guidelines regarding corrections, retractions, or issuing expressions of concern when necessary.
